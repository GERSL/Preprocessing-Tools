The BRDF correction is to use the c-factor approach [(Roy, D. P. et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.01.023) based on the RossThick-LiSparse-R BRDF model [(Schaaf, Crystal B., et al. 2002)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0034-4257(02)00091-3). Additionally, we provide **a Python function (normalize_brdf.py) to simulate target solar angles** described by [Li et al. 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594675). This Python version does not include the core BRDF model (model.py), which was developed by [Dr. Zhang](https://github.com/hankui).

The SCS correction is equivalent to projecting the sunlit canopy from the sloped surface to the horizontal surface in the direction of illumination [(Gu, D. et al., 1998)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0034-4257(97)00177-6).

The SCS+C model is based on the same SCS model, but it integrates a semi-empirical parameter (C) that can significantly reduce the overcorrection caused by the scattered radiation from the source of illumination [(Soenen, S. A. et al., 2005)](https://10.1109/TGRS.2005.852480). Also, the computing efficiency was improved by a  stratified sampling approach [(Qiu, S., et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.07.002).

The IC model was proposed to remove the dependency of the reflectance on the cosine of the local solar incidence angle (cosi) based on the same linear regression shown [(Tan, B. et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.05.013).
